// This file has been intentionally emptied to resolve a build configuration conflict.
// The active configuration is now in src/next.config.ts.
// NOTE: For this change to take effect, you may need to ensure the root `next.config.ts` is deleted
// if it exists, and that the build command correctly references the config in `src`.
// For standard Next.js, it's often best to keep the config at the root.
// We will move it from /src to / for best practice.
